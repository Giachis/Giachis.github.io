			<h2>Our Investment Thesis</h2>	
			<P>Our investment thsis is fairly simple: most startup start and fail. We are not in the starting busines, we're in the "finishing" business! Any entrepreneur recognizes the difference between having an idea and completing it with driven and focused execution and this is where we want to play a key role.</p>

			<h2>What we like</h2>
			<p>So, what is the last mile? Well, to us it means getting things done and, generally speaking, making revenues and creating enough opportunities for the future (pipeline, partnership, exit). If revenues is the KPI we like to focus on, we also realize there's nothing more important in a startup than its team and creating the best team is undoubtely highly critical. We can step in with the right intro or as friendly advice on how to grow and manage your team. </p>
